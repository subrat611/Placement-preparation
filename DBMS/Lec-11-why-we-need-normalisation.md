- [What is Normalisation?](#what-is-normalisation)

### What is Normalisation?

- Normalization is a database design technique that organizes and structures relational databases to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- The main goal of normalization is to eliminate data anomalies, such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, by breaking down large tables into smaller, well-organized tables that adhere to certain rules.
- Normalisation is a step towards DB optimisation.

## Recursion

### What is Recursion?

- Any function which calls itself is called recursion.
- A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem. Each time a function calls itself with a slightly simpler version of the original problem. This sequence of smaller problems must eventually converge on a base case.

**Note: Solve one case rest is handle by recursion.**

# What is Operating System?

- An operating system (OS) is a software component that serves as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user. It provides a set of services and functionalities that enable the efficient execution of programs and the management of computer resources.

> An operating system is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer
> system, both hardware and software, and provides an environment in which the user can
> execute his/her programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding underlying
> complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.

## Why OS?

1. What if there is no OS?

   a. Bulky and complex app. (Hardware interaction code must be in appâ€™s code base)

   b. Resource exploitation by 1 App.

   c. No memory protection.

2. What is an OS made up of?

   a. Collection of system software.

## Here are some key aspects of an operating system:

- **Resource Management:**

  The OS manages hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, disk space, and peripheral devices, to ensure that different programs can run concurrently without interfering with each other.

- **Process Management:**

  It handles processes, which are instances of executing programs. This includes process scheduling, creation, and termination, as well as inter-process communication and synchronization.

- **Memory Management:**

  The OS is responsible for managing the computer's memory hierarchy, allocating and deallocating memory as needed to ensure efficient and secure operation of programs.

- **File System Management:**

  It provides a file system that organizes and stores data on storage devices. This includes managing files, directories, and access permissions.

- **Device Management:**

  The OS interacts with device drivers to facilitate communication between the computer's hardware components and the software applications that use them.

- **User Interface:**

  Operating systems often provide a user interface, which can be command-line based, graphical, or both, to allow users to interact with the system.

- **Security and Protection:**

  It implements security measures to protect the system and its data from unauthorized access and malicious software.

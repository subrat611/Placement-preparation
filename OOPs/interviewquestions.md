### Why do we use OOPs?

- It gives clarity in programming and allows simplicity in solving complex problems.

- Data and code are bound together by encapsulation.

- Code can be reused, and it reduces redundancy.

- It also helps to hide unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.

- Problems can be divided into subparts.

- It increases the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code.

### What are the differences between the constructor and the method?

| Constructor                                                                    | Method                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. It is a block of code that initializes a newly created object.              | 1. It is a group of statements that can be called at any point in the program using its name to perform a specific task. |
| 2. It has the same name as the class name.                                     | 2. It should have a different name than the class name.Jane                                                              |
| 3. It has no return type.                                                      | 3. It needs a valid return type if it returns a value; otherwise void.                                                   |
| 4. It is called implicitly at the time of object creation.                     | 4. It is called explicitly by the programmer by making a method call.                                                    |
| 5. If a constructor is not present, a default constructor is provided by Java. | 5. In the case of a method, no default method is provided.                                                               |

### What are the main features of OOPs?

- Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Data Abstraction.

### The disadvantage of OOPs?

- Requires pre-work and proper planning.

- In certain scenarios, programs can consume a large amount of memory.

- Not suitable for a small problem.

- Proper documentation is required for later use.

### What is the difference between class and structure?

- Class: User-defined blueprint from which objects are created. It consists of methods or sets of instructions that are to be performed on the objects.

- Structure: A structure is basically a user-defined collection of variables of different data types.

### What is the difference between a class and an object?

| Class                                                                 | Object                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Class is the blueprint of an object. It is used to create objects. | 1. An object is an instance of the class.                       |
| 2. No memory is allocated when a class is declared.                   | 2. Memory is allocated as soon as an object is created.         |
| 3. A class is a group of similar objects.                             | 3. An object is a real-world entity such as a book, car, etc.   |
| 4. Class is a logical entity.                                         | 4. An object is a physical entity.                              |
| 5. A class can only be declared once.                                 | 5. Objects can be created many times as per requirement.        |
| 6. An example of class can be a car.                                  | 6. Objects of the class car can be BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari, etc. |
